## Make it Good

This is a sample Android app that demonstrates how to use Firebase Authentication, Crashlytics, Cloud Firestore, Performance Monitoring and Remote Config with Jetpack Compose UI. Make it Good is a simple to-do list application that allows the user to add and edit to-do items, add flags, priorities, due dates, and mark the tasks as completed.

I did a codelab available in this [link](https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/firebase-android-jetpack?authuser=1), for learning jetpack compose and firebase.
